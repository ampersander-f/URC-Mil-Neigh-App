# Some Background Theory

Two-dimensional materials, often called single-layer materials, can be formed using nanoparticles. These materials may be tailored to suit a wide range of needs, with applications that span photovoltaics, microelectronics, and surface chemistry/catalysis (e.g. water purification). My lab was interested in 2D materials with unusually high tensile strengths (resistance to breaking under mechanical stresses like shear force), specifically thiol-ligated gold nanoparticle monolayers. These nanoparticles have a solid gold core, made of a few hundred gold atoms, which were then covered in hydrocarbon 'hairs' attached via sulfur atoms ("thiol-ligated"). The tensile strength of these layers is attributed to a velcro-like effect of the hairs with neighboring particles.  

Our goal for this project was to develop an empirical theory of the properties of these 2D films, so that it would be possible to precisely manipulate the films (potential direct applications included dispersing a chemical catalyst throughout the film, then transforming it into useful shapes like cylinders or high-surface-area forms, e.g.). One group on this project did wet lab work, where the nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of water, then compressed in different ways to allow the films to self-assemble. Key to this was the use of Wilhelmy plates, which are very thin metal rectangles suspended by fishing wire so that the bottom of the plates are submerged. By orienting one perpendicular and the other parallel to the direction of compression, we may observe the change in surface pressure as the 'velcro effect' draws the nanoparticles closer together. The surface pressures are then integrated over the surface area of the film to find two useful measures of tensile strength: the Strain Modulus (resistance to stretching) and the Shear Modulus (resistance to twisting). Eventually these forces grow to the point of collapse, and the monolayer begins 'folding' into a bilayer.  

My project aimed to replicate these experimental results using simulations. A Pritzker Institute for Molecular Engineering graduate student built a molecular dynamics simulation engine that we adapted for use with our supercomputing cluster ([link to github page for the engine](https://github.com/dreid1991/md_engine)). By doing many first-principles MD simulations of two, three, and seven nanoparticles drawing closer together (i.e. simulating the nanoparticles by monitoring each carbon atom on the 'hairs' and measuring their attractive energies), we were able to develop empirical equations for the potential function--in other words, we had an equation that if we knew how far apart two nanoparticles were, we could calculate the strength of the velcro effect between them. The engine and the potential functions were then used for Monte Carlo methods to model how the monolayer changes under compression.  

The strain and stress moduli curves from the simulations were eventually found to match the experimental ones (using 7 nanoparticles to find the potential function yielded results on the same order as the results from experiment, whereas using only 2 or 3 only matched the general shape of the curves but overestimated their strength). From this, we were confident that the simulations could provide useful mechanistic insight to the collapse of the monolayer at the moments of high stress (and it's much cheaper to run simulations than to buy gold nanoparticles for each tiny change you want to make). Additionally, the simulations verified that the equilibrium assumptions of the experimental conditions held, which were important in many of its applications; the most important was that the collapse patterns that we observed, which formed diagonal striations across the layer, were a result of only interparticle interactions and totally independent of the compressions we were doing (i.e. the compression of the monolayer was slow enough that the system was at equilibrium at all times).   

In its current form, the project is focused on evaluating the effect of each of the key variables on monolayer collapse: 
* height distributions (do random fluctuations in particle height determine where collapse occurs?)
* packing and lattice effects (transition state theory, or in essence, do misalignments in packing density determine collapse location?)
* local pressure fluctuations (what does the pressure look like at points of interest, not just wherever a Wilhelmy plate is?)
* local free energy fluctuations (how much energy from attractions between nanoparticles is released when the bilayer collapses? is there an energy threshhold that determines when collapse happens? are the striations we observe a consequence of minimizing the energy of the bilayer?)
It is hoped that by understanding the mechanism of collapse, self-assembling monolayers may be eventually applied towards macroscopic self-assembling materials.
